## About Me
I am a Compliance Analyst in the Financial Crime Unit with a background in Electrical Electronics Engineering. In 2019, I decided to acquire new skills and ventured into software development. I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and gained proficiency in these technologies. While pursuing opportunities in the tech industry, I came across Andela, a company specializing in employing software developers from Nigeria. Although my journey with Andela did not result in employment, it fueled my ambition to continue my career in the tech field.

In the UK, I further expanded my skill set and developed a keen interest in working with data. I delved into Python, SQL, data wrangling, and visualization using Power BI. I actively engage with various data sets, especially the Adventures data sets, querying and presenting them in different ways to gain insights. Alongside my role as a KYC/AML/Compliance Analyst, I dedicate my evenings to advancing my knowledge and skills in data science. Currently, I am undergoing a fully paid Govt sponsored Data Science Bootcamp with Hyperion Dev School where I have really sharpened my data Analytic skills and ready for a Data Analyst/Science Role with the knowledge I am gaining from this prestigious bootcamp.
